## Overview

The `defineBlock` function in GamanJS is a powerful abstraction for organizing services, routes, middlewares, and dependencies into a cohesive unit. Blocks are reusable, isolated modules that can be composed together to form a full-featured application structure.

## Purpose

Blocks serve as the foundation for modular architecture in GamanJS. Each block can encapsulate:

- Services
- Routes
- Middlewares
- Integrations
- Nested blocks (submodules)
- Custom error handlers
- Custom `404` handlers

## Structure

A block is defined using the `defineBlock()` function and typically exported from a file such as `*.block.ts`.

### Key Properties

- `path?`: The base path prefix for all routes in this block.
- `includes?`: An array of elements (middleware, child blocks, or integrations) to be applied and composed within the current block. Useful for grouping reusable logic, nested modules, or third-party extensions into a single composable unit.
- `bindings?`: Injected values such as services or external dependencies (e.g., database client, logger). 
- `routes?`: Route factories associated with this block.
- `priority?`: Determines the execution order of blocks.
- `error?`: Custom error handler for exceptions thrown inside the block.
- `404?`: Handler for undefined routes in this block.

## Usage Example

```ts
// example.block.ts
export default defineBlock({
  path: "/user",
  bindings: {
    userService,
  },
  routes: [userRoutes],
});
```

After that, you can add your block to `main.block.ts`

```ts
// main.block.ts
export default defineBlock({
  path: "/",
  includes: [userBlock],
});
```

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

<Aside type="tip">
  you can use the CLI's Block maker:

  <PackageManagers pkgManagers={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]} type="exec" args="gaman make:block <name>"/>
</Aside>

## Best Practices

- Group related logic (routes + services) into their own block.
- Use `includes` for reusable middlewares.
- Use `priority` to control registration order for overlapping paths.
- Compose blocks using the `blocks` array for scalable structure.

## Benefits

- Encourages separation of concerns.
- Promotes reusability and testability.
- Enables clear hierarchical module structure.

## Summary

Blocks in GamanJS are a flexible and powerful way to build modular backend applications. They unify routing, services, and context-based dependencies in a clean, declarative format that supports scaling and maintainability.
