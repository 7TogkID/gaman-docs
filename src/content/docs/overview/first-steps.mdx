title: First Step
description: GamanJS is a modular and efficient backend framework designed for simplicity and performance. Follow the steps below to quickly get started with your first GamanJS project.
---

### Language

GamanJS is specifically designed to work with modern`TypeScript` using the ECMAScript Module (ESM) system. This means all modules must be written using `import` and `export` syntaxâ€”CommonJS (`require`, `module.exports`) is not supported. If you're building a project with GamanJS, make sure your environment and codebase are fully ESM-compatible.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that `Node.js` (version >= 18.x) is installed on your operating system.

## Create first application

import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

  pkg="gaman@latest"
  pkgManagers={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]}
  type="create"
/>
