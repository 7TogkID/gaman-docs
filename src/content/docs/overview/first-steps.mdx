title: First Step
description: GamanJS is a modular and efficient backend framework designed for simplicity and performance. Follow the steps below to quickly get started with your first GamanJS project.
---

### Language

GamanJS is specifically designed to work with modern`TypeScript` using the ECMAScript Module (ESM) system. This means all modules must be written using `import` and `export` syntaxâ€”CommonJS (`require`, `module.exports`) is not supported. If you're building a project with GamanJS, make sure your environment and codebase are fully ESM-compatible.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that `Node.js` (version >= 18.x) is installed on your operating system.

## Installation

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

<Steps>
    1. GamanJS is a framework for backend applications, You can create it using your favorite package manager:
        <PackageManagers pkg="gaman@latest" pkgManagers={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]} type="create"/>
    2. generate your `GAMAN_KEY`, usually this will be created automatically
        <PackageManagers pkgManagers={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]} type="exec" args="gaman key:generate"/>
    4. Start the development server 
        <PackageManagers pkgManagers={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]} type="run" args="dev"/>

</Steps>

## Project Structure

import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

After creating a new project, your file structure will look like this:

<FileTree>
- src
  - module
    - ...
  - index.d.ts
  - index.ts
  - main.block.ts
  - main.routes.ts
  - main.service.ts
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
</FileTree>


| File             | description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| main.ts          | App entry point. Runs and loads all modules.            |

| main.routes.ts   | Defines HTTP routes handler                             |
