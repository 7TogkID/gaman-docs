GamanJS uses a modular structure to organize application features cleanly and scalably. Each module consists of **three primary files**

## Block

`*.block.ts`: This file is the heart of your module. For example, if you're building a `user` module, then `user.block.ts` serves as its core. It's where you register the module's routes, services, dependencies, middlewares, and more.

Read more about block modules at the following link, [Explore Block Module further](/module/block)

```ts
// user.block.ts
export default defineBlock({
  path: "/user",
  routes: [userRoutes],
  services: {
    appService: userService,
  },
  dependencies: {
    database: new PrismaClient(),
  },
});
```

## Routes

`*.routes.ts`: This file is where you define your routes, such as `/user/create`, etc. Make sure to keep your route definitions clean and simple — that’s why we separate the logic into services. Let your services handle the “messy” parts, while the routes stay clean and organized.

Read more about routes modules at the following link, [Explore Routes Module further](/module/routes)

```ts
// user.routes.ts
interface Deps {
  database: PrismaClient;
  appService: ReturnType<typeof userService>;
}

export default defineRoutes(({ database, appService }: Deps) => ({
  "/create": async (ctx) => {
    await appService.createUser(ctx.param("name"));
    return r.json({ message: "OK!" });
  },
  "/find": async (ctx) => {
    const users = await appService.findUser();
    return users;
  },
}));
```

## Service

`*.service.ts`: This file is used to define your core business logic and helper functions. It's recommended to avoid making any HTTP responses or requests directly in service files.

Read more about service modules at the following link, [Explore Service Module further](/module/service)

```ts
// user.service.ts
interface Deps {
  database: PrismaClient;
}

export default defineService(({ database }: Deps) => ({
  createUser: async (name) => {
    await database.insert({ name });
  },
  findUser: async () => {
    return await database.findMany({});
  },
}));
```

## Tips

- Always name files with the same prefix to ensure they’re grouped correctly.
- Keep logic isolated: avoid mixing route and business logic in the same file.b
- For larger apps, use folders to logically separate modules (`auth/`, `admin/`, etc).
